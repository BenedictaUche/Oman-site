            <h2>How To Get Diabetes</h2>
            <p>Diabetes  is a chronic disease in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar), either because of 
                inadequate insulin production, or because of poor response of body cells to insulin, or both. Insulin is an 
                Hormone secreted by ÃŸ cells of islets of the pancreas  which is an organ  present in the abdomen and  near  
                the stomach. All carbohydrate foods that we eat are broken down into glucose which passes from the blood 
                stream into the cells to produce energy. Also glucose can be  formed  from other food stuffs. Insulin's role is to 
                take glucose  from the blood into the cells. So  because of the absolute or relative deficiency of insulin, 
                glucose level will rise in the blood (known as hyperglycemia). Patients with high blood sugar will typically 
                experience polyuria (frequent urination), they will become increasingly thirsty (polydipsia) and hungry (Polyphagia). 
                Over the long-term high glucose levels are associated with damage to the body and failure of various organs and tissues.
