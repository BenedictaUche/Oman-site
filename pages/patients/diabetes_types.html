                <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
                <p class="text line"></p>
                <h3>Type 1 Diabetes(T1DM)</h3>
                <p class="type-one">It  may affect people of any age, but usually develops in children or young adults.
                    So, often referred to as<br><b>Juvenile diabetes</b>. The body does not produce insulin and
                    exact causes are still unknown, nevertheless,<br> it is mostly caused by an auto-immune
                    reaction resulting in the destruction of ÃŸ Cells of pancreas leading<br>to total Insulin
                    deficiency, so the only treatment are the insulin injections that is why it is referred
                    to as<br><b>insulin dependent diabetes</b>. The onset of type 1 diabetes is usually sudden
                    and dramatic.<br>Approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type 1.
                </p>
                <h3>Type 2 Diabetes(T2DM)</h3>
                <p class="type-two">It is the most common type of diabetes (90-95%) and occurs mostly in the adult population.<br>
                    So used to be called non-insulin dependent diabetes or adult-onset diabetes.<br>
                    The body does not produce enough insulin for proper function, or the cells in the body do<br>
                    not react to insulin (insulin resistance).Overweight and obese people have a much higher risk<br>
                    of developing type 2 diabetes .The risk is greater as we get older and in those with a close<br>
                    relative who has type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes may remain undetected for many years and the<br>
                    diagnosis is often made when a complication appears or a routine blood or urine glucose test is done.<br>
                    It is treated initially by meal planning and exercise. If that is not enough to control it then <br>
                    medications will be added. The symptoms can often be mild or even absent in people with type 2 diabetes.<br>
                    However, type 2 diabetes is typically a progressive disease - it gradually gets worse - and the<br>
                    patient will probably end up have to take insulin.
                </p>
                <h3>Gestational Diabetes(GDM)</h3>
                <p>This type affects females during pregnancy. It develops in one in 25 pregnancies worldwide and if<br>
                    undiagnosed or uncontrolled  it  can raise the risk of complications to both mother and baby.<br>
                    The baby may be bigger than he/she should be. GDM usually disappears after pregnancy but women<br>
                    with GDM and their offspring are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.<br>
                    Approximately half of women with a history of GDM go on to develop type 2 diabetes within five to ten years<br>
                    after delivery. The majority of gestational diabetes patients can control their diabetes with exercise and<br>
                    diet, but ,some of them  will need to take some kind of blood-glucose-controlling medications mostly insulin.

                <p>See your doctor so he or she can perform tests to determine whether or not you have diabetes or prediabetes.<br>
                    Your doctor will make recommendations to bring down your blood sugar level to treat diabetes or so that you can <br>
                    delay the development of diabetes.
